# ✅ Workflow to lint dbt models using SQLFluff on every PR targeting the main branch

name: SQLFluff lint dbt models

# 🟢 Trigger this workflow on pull requests to 'main' where SQL files in 'models/' are changed
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
    paths:
      - 'models/**/*.sql'

# 🧪 Global environment variables for the job
env:
  DBT_PROFILES_DIR: ./                      # Use the current directory as the dbt profiles location
  DBT_TARGET: ci                            # Set the dbt target (must match your profiles.yml)
  DBT_PR_ID: "${{ github.event.number }}"   # Capture the PR number (can be used for commenting, tagging, etc.)

jobs:
  sqlfluff-lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest   # 🖥️ Use the latest Ubuntu runner

    steps:
      # 🧾 Step 1: Checkout the code from the PR
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 2  # Shallow clone with history of last 2 commits

      # 🐍 Step 2: Set up Python environment for SQLFluff
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.12'

      # 📦 Step 3: Install dependencies (dbt, sqlfluff, etc.)
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      # 🔐 Step 4: Authenticate to Google Cloud (for dbt to work with BigQuery)
      - name: Authenticate to Google Cloud
        uses: google-github-actions/auth@v2
        with:
          credentials_json: '${{ secrets.GCP_SA_KEY }}'
          export_environment_variables: true  # Expose creds as env vars for dbt/sqlfluff

      # 🧾 Step 5: Detect only the SQL files that were changed in the PR
      - name: Changed Files
        id: changed-files
        uses: tj-actions/changed-files@v42.0.2
        with:
          files: models/**/*.sql

      # 💾 Step 6 (Optional): Backup original files — not strictly needed for linting (used more for fixing)
      - name: Backup Original Files
        run: |
          for file in ${{ steps.changed-files.outputs.all_changed_files }}
          do
            cp "$file" "$file.bak"
          done

      # 📥 Step 7: Install dbt packages if any are specified in packages.yml
      - name: Install dbt packages
        run: |
          dbt deps

      # ✅ Step 8: Run SQLFluff linter on changed files
      # ❌ This step will FAIL the workflow if there are any linting errors
      - name: Lint dbt models
        continue-on-error: false  # Important: fail if linting fails
        if: steps.changed-files.outputs.all_changed_files != ''
        run: |
          sqlfluff lint ${{ steps.changed-files.outputs.all_changed_files }}

      # 🔒 Step 9 (Optional): Block merging if required — not fully functional unless you set env.NO_CHANGES before
      - name: Set Merge Block Flag
        if: env.NO_CHANGES == 'false'
        run: echo "MERGE_BLOCKED=true" >> "$GITHUB_ENV"

      # 🚫 Step 10 (Optional): Prevent PR merge manually by failing the job if merge blocked
      - name: Prevent Merge
        if: env.MERGE_BLOCKED == 'true'
        run: |
          echo "Merging is blocked due to SQL linting errors."
          exit 1
